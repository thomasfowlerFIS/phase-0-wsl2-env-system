# Updating Your Windows System and Installing Applications

WSL2 is compatible with the Home, Pro, or Server editions of Windows but not
Windows 10 S (although you can often upgrade to the Home edition for free).

## Check That your Windows system is Compatible with Academy Xi’s Requirements

When working on software, your computer and the software you’re using must be
compatible. In this step, we’ll ensure that you are able to install all the
tools that you will need to complete the program.

### Action Item: Check your Windows System Specifications

1. Open the "Settings" application using the "Start" menu
2. Select the "System" option
3. Select "About" at the bottom of the list
4. Scroll down to the "Windows specifications" heading
5. Check that your "Edition" is one of the following: Windows 10 Home, Windows
   10 Pro, Windows 10 Server
